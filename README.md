## Hunger Games
This repository contains the source code of a survival game (similar to the concept of Hunger Games) which I have made for
the Season of Code Project. Its a top-down game where player controls a sprite with basic movements like **Left,Right,Up,Down**
and **Rotate**
The aim is to survive as long as you can by collecting resources like **Wood** , **Stones** and **Food**. These resources can 
further be used to build tools which enables longer survival.
